### Updating from PhantomCSS v0 to v1

Rendering is quite different with PhantomJS 2, so when you update, old visual tests will start failing.
If your tests are green and passing before updating, I would recommend rebasing the visual tests, i.e. delete them, and run the test suite to create a new baseline.

You can still use the [v0 branch](https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS/tree/v0) if you wish, though it now unmaintained.
